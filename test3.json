This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread.

However, the field quickly expanded to include environmental concerns and issues related to the North-South wealth\/poverty divide.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because peace studies did not develop as a discipline following the Cold War. Instead, it emerged as a response to the failures of International Relations after World War II.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because peace studies did not focus solely on weapons accumulation or the nuclear arms race. While these issues were initially important, the field quickly expanded to include a wide range of topics related to peace and conflict resolution.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because peace studies did not focus on promoting peace through the equal distribution of resources. While resource allocation is an important issue related to peace and conflict resolution, it is not the primary focus of peace studies.",

The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration does de las Casas seem to be criticizing in Source 2?\n(A): Converting the natives to Christianity\n(B): Financial gain\n(C): Personal glory\n(D): Finding new mates",

The pods are covered in thorns and contain sweet, edible seeds that are often eaten by birds and other wildlife.\n\nHoney locust trees are relatively fast-growing and can reach heights of up to 50 feet (15 meters). They are hardy in zones 3 through 8 and can be grown in a variety of soils, including clay, loam, and sand. They are also drought-tolerant and can tolerate poor soil conditions.\n\nThere are several varieties of honey locust trees, including:\n\n* Gleditsia triacanthos var. inermis (thornless honey locust): This variety is grown for its thornless stems and leaves, which make it a good choice for landscaping.\n* Gleditsia triacanthos var. triacanthos (thorny honey locust): This variety is known for its showy, thorny seed pods and is often grown as an ornamental tree.\n* Gleditsia triacanthos var. latifolia (sweet honey locust): This variety is known for its sweet, edible seeds and is often grown for food and wildlife habitat.\n\nOverall, the honey locust is a versatile and attractive tree that is well-suited to a variety of landscaping uses.",

Here are some of his philosophical ideas that continue to influence contemporary culture:\n\n1. The Death of God: Nietzsche famously declared the death of God, arguing that with the decline of traditional religious beliefs, humanity was faced with the challenge of creating new values and meanings in life. This idea has influenced modern atheism, existentialism, and the questioning of traditional authority.\n2. The Will to Power: Nietzsche believed that the fundamental drive of human beings is the will to power, which expresses itself in creativity, self-overcoming, and the pursuit of excellence. This idea has influenced modern notions of personal development, self-actualization, and the importance of individual freedom and autonomy.\n3. The Eternal Recurrence: Nietzsche proposed the idea of the eternal recurrence, which posits that all events in the universe will recur infinitely. This idea has influenced modern notions of existentialism, the cyclical nature of history, and the importance of living a meaningful and fulfilling life.\n4. The Perspectivism: Nietzsche believed that all knowledge and truth is relative and subjective, and that different perspectives on the world are valid in different contexts. This idea has influenced modern notions of postmodernism, the importance of multiple perspectives, and the challenge of objectivity in knowledge.\n5. The Critique of Morality: Nietzsche argued that traditional morality is based on a false belief in objective moral standards, and that true freedom and self-actualization require a transcendence of conventional moral values. This idea has influenced modern critiques of traditional morality, the importance of personal responsibility, and the need for individuals to create their own values and meanings in life.\n6. The Ubermensch: Nietzsche introduced the concept of the Ubermensch (often translated as \"Superman\"), who embodies the highest human values of creativity, self-overcoming, and the will to power. This idea has influenced modern notions of self-actualization, personal growth, and the importance of striving for excellence.\n7. The Critique of Modern Society: Nietzsche was critical of modern society, which he saw as being based on a false belief in objective truth, a lack of individual freedom, and a repression of natural human impulses. This critique has influenced modern critiques of consumerism, the importance of individualism, and the need for social change.\n8. The Art of Living: Nietzsche believed that the highest human goal is to create a life of excellence, beauty, and self-expression, and that this requires a willingness to take risks, embrace challenges, and reject conformity. This idea has influenced modern notions of personal growth, self-actualization, and the importance of living a meaningful and fulfilling life.\n\nNietzsche's ideas have had a profound and lasting impact on modern culture, influencing fields such as philosophy, literature, art, music, and psychology. His critiques of traditional morality, the importance of individual freedom and self-expression, and the will to power continue to inspire and challenge individuals today.",

    "output_3":" If the Aztecs had successfully repelled the Spanish conquistadors, it is likely that their empire would have continued to exist and thrive, and that the course of history in Mesoamerica would have been very different. Here are a few possible outcomes:\n\n1. Continued Aztec dominance: The Aztecs were a powerful and well-organized empire, and they would have likely continued to expand their territory and influence if the Spanish had been repelled. They may have even gone on to conquer the Mayans and other neighboring civilizations, further solidifying their position as the dominant power in Mesoamerica.\n2. Different colonial history: Without the Spanish conquest, Mesoamerica would not have been colonized by European powers. This means that the region would have avoided the devastating effects of colonialism, including the loss of native populations, the introduction of diseases, and the exploitation of resources.\n3. Preservation of indigenous cultures: The Aztecs and other indigenous civilizations of Mesoamerica would have been able to maintain their cultural practices, religions, and traditions without interference from European colonizers. This would have allowed these cultures to continue to evolve and flourish, and they may have even had a greater impact on the development of world civilizations.\n4. Different religious landscape: The Spanish conquest of the Aztecs was motivated in part by a desire to convert the native populations to Christianity. Without this conquest, it is possible that the indigenous religions of Mesoamerica would have continued to thrive, and that the region would have had a different religious landscape.\n5. No Mexico as we know it: Without the Spanish conquest, there would be no Mexico as we know it today. The country would not have been founded by the Spanish, and it is possible that the region would have developed into a different kind of society, with its own unique culture, language, and institutions.\n6. The Aztecs would have continued to practice human sacrifice: One of the most controversial aspects of the Aztec civilization was their practice of human sacrifice. It is possible that this practice would have continued if the Spanish had been repelled, and that the Aztecs would have continued to sacrifice humans as part of their religious rituals.\n7. The Mayans and other civilizations would have continued to thrive: The Spanish conquest had a devastating impact on the Mayans and other civilizations of Mesoamerica. Without this conquest, it is possible that these civilizations would have continued to thrive, and that they would have played a greater role in the development of world civilizations.\n8. The Aztecs would have continued to trade with other civilizations: The Aztecs were a major trading power in Mesoamerica, and they would have likely continued to trade with other civilizations if the Spanish had been repelled. This would have allowed for the exchange of goods, ideas, and culture, and it is possible that the region would have been a major hub of global trade and commerce.\n9. No Spanish language: Without the Spanish conquest, it is possible that the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica would have prevailed, and that the Spanish language would not have been introduced to the region.\n10. A different modern Mexico: The Mexican identity is deeply rooted in its indigenous heritage, and without the Spanish conquest, it is possible that the country would have developed a different modern identity, one that is more closely tied to its indigenous roots.\n\nOverall, if the Aztecs had successfully repelled the Spanish conquistadors, Mesoamerica would have developed in a very different way, with a unique set of cultural, political, and economic outcomes.",

    "output_2":" Yes, the 5-second rule is real. Research suggests that food dropped on a clean surface can be safely consumed for up to 5 seconds before contamination becomes a concern. However, the validity of the rule is debated, and it's not a hard and fast rule for all situations.",
    "generator_2":"helpful_all_brief_13b",
    "dataset_2":"helpful_base",
    "output_3":" The 5-second rule is a widely held belief that if you pick up food that has fallen on the ground within five seconds, it is still safe to eat. However, the scientific evidence on this topic is mixed, and it's not a clear-cut issue. Here's a breakdown of the various studies and expert opinions on the matter:\n\n1. The original study: The 5-second rule was popularized by a 2007 study published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology. The study found that the time it takes for bacteria to transfer from a floor surface to a moist surface (like food) is less than five seconds. However, the study also noted that the type of surface and the type of bacteria present can affect the transfer time.\n2. Other studies: Since the original study, several other studies have explored the 5-second rule, but the results have been inconsistent. Some studies have found that bacteria can transfer to food almost instantly, while others have found that the transfer time can be longer than five seconds.\n3. Bacteria growth: The key factor in determining whether food is safe to eat after falling on the ground is not the transfer time, but rather the growth of bacteria on the food. Bacteria can grow rapidly on moist, nutrient-rich surfaces like food, especially when it's exposed to warm temperatures.\n4. Factors affecting bacterial growth: The growth of bacteria on food is influenced by several factors, including the type of food, the surface it falls on, the temperature of the environment, and the presence of moisture. For example, moist, high-protein foods like meat and dairy products are more likely to support bacterial growth than dry, low-protein foods like bread or crackers.\n5. Expert opinions: While there is no clear consensus on the 5-second rule, many food safety experts agree that it's best to err on the side of caution and discard any food that has come into contact with the ground. The USDA recommends that consumers \"not eat food that has been left on the ground for any length of time\" to avoid the risk of foodborne illness.\n\nIn summary, the 5-second rule is not a hard and fast rule, and the safety of food that has fallen on the ground depends on various factors, including the type of food, the surface it falls on, and the temperature of the environment. It's generally best to discard any food that has come into contact with the ground to avoid the risk of foodborne illness.",

Use technology to limit your usage: There are many apps and features available that can help you limit your phone usage. For example, you can use a feature like \"Screen Time\" on iOS devices or \"Digital Wellbeing\" on Android devices to track how much time you spend on your phone and set limits for certain apps.\n3. Keep your phone out of reach: If you're not actively using your phone, keep it out of reach. This can make it more difficult to mindlessly scroll through social media or check your notifications.\n4. Find alternative ways to spend your time: Instead of using your phone, try engaging in other activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. This could be anything from reading a book to exercising to spending time with friends and family.\n5. Practice mindfulness: Be more mindful of your phone usage and make an effort to be present in the moment. When you find yourself reaching for your phone out of habit or boredom, pause and ask yourself if it's really necessary.\n6. Set up phone-free zones: Designate certain areas or times of the day as phone-free. For example, you might make your bedroom or dining table a phone-free zone.\n7. Use phone-blocking software: There are many tools available that can block distracting websites or apps during certain times of the day or for certain periods of time.\n8. Take breaks from social media: Social media can be a major source of phone addiction. Consider taking a break from social media for a few days or a week to see how it affects your phone usage.\n9. Use your phone's built-in features to help you use it less: Many phones have built-in features that can help you use them less. For example, you can use the \"Do Not Disturb\" feature to silence notifications during certain times of the day or the \"Reading Mode\" feature to block distracting notifications.\n10. Consider replacing your phone with a \"dumb phone\": If you find that you're using your phone too much, consider replacing it with a \"dumb phone\" that has basic calling and texting capabilities but no internet access. This can help you break the habit of constant phone usage.\n\nRemember, it's important to set realistic goals and use a combination of these strategies to find what works best for you. It takes time and effort to break the habit of excessive phone usage, but the benefits to your mental and physical health are well worth it.",

By iteratively applying the algorithm, the input image is gradually refined, resulting in a higher quality output.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1. Upscaling: The stable diffusion algorithm can effectively upscale low resolution images, resulting in a higher quality output that is closer to the original image.\n2. Efficient image compression: The algorithm can also be used for efficient image compression, as it can reduce the amount of data required to represent an image while preserving its quality.\n3.

    "output_3":" Certainly! The stable diffusion algorithm (SDA) is a deep learning-based method for enhancing the visual quality of low-resolution and low-quality images. It uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn a diffusion process that progressively refines the input image, resulting in a higher-quality output. Here's how it works and some of its potential advantages and limitations:\n\nWorking principle:\n\n1. Training: The SDA is trained on a dataset of high-quality images.\n2. Diffusion process: Given a low-quality input image, the SDA applies a diffusion process that progressively refines the image, step by step. Each step consists of two parts:\n\na. Noising the input image: The input image is noised to introduce randomness and prevent overfitting.\n\nb. Diffusion step: The noisy image is passed through a series of transmission filters, which are learned during training. The filters refine the image by removing noise and enhancing details.\n3. Adversarial loss: The diffusion process is trained using an adversarial loss function that measures the difference between the output and the target high-quality image.\n4. Stability: The SDA is designed to ensure stability during the diffusion process, preventing overfitting and preserving the underlying structure of the input image.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1. Flexibility: The SDA can be used for various image enhancement tasks, such as upscaling, denoising, and deblurring.\n2. Improved quality: The SDA can produce higher-quality outputs compared to traditional image enhancement methods, especially when the input images are highly degraded.\n3. Efficient: The SDA is computationally efficient and can process images in real-time.\n\nLimitations:\n\n1. Limited control: The SDA is a black-box model, and the output is largely determined by the training data and the network architecture. Users may have limited control over the enhancement process.\n2. Domain gap: The SDA may struggle with images from different domains or with significant variations in lighting, pose, or style.\n3. Over-smoothing: The SDA may over-smooth the output, losing important details or texture.\n\nPotential applications:\n\n1. Upscaling: The SDA can be used to upscale low-resolution images, potentially improving the quality of digital images or videos.\n2. Efficient image compression: The SDA can be used to enhance the quality of compressed images, potentially reducing the amount of data required for transmission or storage.\n3. Content generation: The SDA can be used to generate new images based on a given input or style, potentially useful in creative fields like CGI and digital art.\n4. Image reconstruction: The SDA can be used to reconstruct images from partially corrupted or noisy data, potentially useful in applications like medical imaging or astronomical imaging.\n\nIn conclusion, the stable diffusion algorithm has the potential to significantly enhance the visual quality of low-resolution and low-quality images, with advantages in flexibility, efficiency, and improved quality. However, there are limitations to the model's control, domain gap, and over-smoothing, which may impact its performance in certain scenarios. As the field of computer vision and deep learning continues to evolve, further research and development may address these limitations and expand the capabilities of the SDA.",

For example, you might use it to calculate the limit of a fraction as the denominator approaches zero, or to find the limit of a function as the input value approaches a singularity. Additionally, L'Hopital's Rule can be useful in a variety of real-world applications, such as in calculus-based models of physical systems, optimization problems, and data analysis.",

    "output_3":" L'Hopital's Rule is a mathematical tool used to find the limit of a function as the input variable approaches infinity or negative infinity. While it may not be directly applicable in day-to-day life, there are some situations where the rule can be useful in a more abstract sense. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Infinite Series: L'Hopital's Rule can be used to determine the limit of an infinite series. For example, if you have a series like $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2}$, you can use L'Hopital's Rule to show that the limit is $\\frac{1}{0}$, which is undefined. This can be useful in understanding the convergence properties of infinite series.\n2. Integrals: L'Hopital's Rule can also be used to evaluate improper integrals, which are integrals that extend over an infinite or semi-infinite range. For example, the improper integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$ can be evaluated using L'Hopital's Rule, leading to the result $\\frac{1}{0}$, which is undefined.\n3. Limits of Functions: L'Hopital's Rule can be used to find the limit of a function as the input variable approaches infinity or negative infinity. For example, the limit of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ as $x \\to \\infty$ can be evaluated using L'Hopital's Rule, leading to the result $0$.\n4. Asymptotics: L'Hopital's Rule can be used to study the asymptotic behavior of functions as the input variable approaches infinity or negative infinity. For example, the function $f(x) = e^x$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$, which can be determined using L'Hopital's Rule.\n5. Optimization: L'Hopital's Rule can be used in optimization problems to find the maximum or minimum of a function. For example, the maximum of the function $f(x) = x^2 e^{-x}$ can be found using L'Hopital's Rule, leading to the result $x = 0$.\n\nIn summary, L'Hopital's Rule is a powerful tool for evaluating limits of functions as the input variable approaches infinity or negative infinity. While it may not be directly applicable in day-to-day life, it has a wide range of applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other fields where mathematical limits and asymptotics are important.",

This estimate is based on the age of the Earth, which is around 4.5 billion years, and the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun, which is approximately 365.24 days.\n\nHere's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old, based on radiometric dating and other geological evidence.\n2. The Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 93 million miles (149.6 million kilometers).\n3. The Earth takes approximately 365.24 days to complete one orbit around the Sun.\n4. To calculate the number of orbits the Earth has completed since the beginning of life, we need to know the age of the Earth in days.\n5. There are 365.24 days in a year, so the Earth has orbited the Sun approximately 3.5 billion times (4.5 billion years x 365.24 days\/year).\n\nTherefore, the Earth has orbited the Sun approximately 3.5 billion times since the beginning of life.",

    "output_3":" It's difficult to determine the exact number of times the Earth has orbited the Sun since the beginning of life, as the exact age of life on Earth is still a subject of scientific debate and exploration. However, we can make an educated estimate based on our current understanding of the Earth's age and the rate of orbital periods.\n\nAccording to radiometric dating and other geological methods, the Earth is estimated to be approximately 4.5 billion years old. This means that the Earth has been orbiting the Sun for approximately 4.5 billion years.\n\nHowever, life on Earth is believed to have first emerged around 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean era of the Precambrian period. This means that the Earth has orbited the Sun at least 3.5 billion times since the beginning of life.\n\nTo calculate the number of times the Earth has orbited the Sun since the beginning of life, we need to know the rate of the Earth's orbital period. The Earth takes approximately 365.24 days to orbit the Sun once, which works out to approximately 1.0127 orbital periods per year.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the number of times the Earth has orbited the Sun since the beginning of life as follows:\n\n3.5 billion years x 1.0127 orbital periods per year \u2248 3,579,233,500,000 orbital periods\n\nSo, the Earth has orbited the Sun at least 3,579,233,500,000 times since the beginning of life. This is a rough estimate that is based on our current understanding of the Earth's age and the rate of orbital periods, but it gives us a sense of just how many times the Earth has circled the Sun over the course of its history.",

    "output_3":" Human blood is typically red, but it can take on a range of colors depending on the circumstances. Here are some possible colors of human blood:\n\n1. Red: This is the most common color of human blood, and it's due to the presence of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.\n2. Purple: When blood is oxygenated, it can take on a purplish hue. This is because the hemoglobin molecule, which is responsible for carrying oxygen, absorbs blue and green light, giving the blood a purple color.\n3. Blue: In some cases, blood can appear blue, particularly in vessels that are very small or in individuals with certain medical conditions. This is because the blue light scattering properties of the blood can give it a blue appearance.\n4. Pink: Blood can also appear pink, especially in newborn babies and in the early stages of pregnancy. This is because the blood vessels in these individuals are still developing and may not be fully mature, leading to a pinkish color.\n5. Yellow: In some cases, blood can appear yellow, particularly in individuals with liver or kidney disease. This is because the body may be producing excess bilirubin, a yellow pigment that can give the blood a yellow color.\n6. Green: In rare cases, blood can appear green, particularly in individuals with a condition called hemochromatosis. This is because the body is producing too much iron, which can discolor the blood.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these colors are possible, they are not common and are usually a sign of an underlying medical condition.

These early mounds were often simple in design, consisting of a single platform or terrace with a few symbols or features.\n\nThe most complex and elaborate effigy mounds were built during the Mississippian period, which spanned from around 1000 to 1500 CE. These mounds were often built in the shapes of animals, birds, and other symbols, and were sometimes accompanied by burial mounds and other ceremonial features.\n\nThe construction of effigy mounds declined after the Mississippian period, as new cultural and political systems emerged in the region. However, some effigy mounds were still built during the Post-Mississippian period (1500 - 1800 CE), and some were even built in historic times by Native American tribes.\n\nIt's worth noting that the exact dates of effigy mound construction can vary depending on the specific region and the available archaeological evidence. However, in general, most of the effigy mounds were built during the Late Woodland and Mississippian periods.",

    "output_3":" The story of the Trojan War originates from ancient Greek mythology and literature. The most well-known accounts of the war are found in Homer's epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey, which were composed in the 8th or 7th century BCE.\n\nAccording to Homer, the Trojan War was a ten-year conflict between the city-states of Troy and Greece, sparked by the abduction of Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, by Paris, the prince of Troy. The war was fought between the Greeks, led by King Agamemnon, and the Trojans, led by King Priam. The climax of the war was the duel between the hero Achilles and the Trojan prince Hector, which ended with the death of Hector and the breach of the walls of Troy.\n\nThe story of the Trojan War has its roots in pre-Hellenic mythology and oral traditions, and was passed down through generations before being written down in the form of epic poems. The mythological elements of the story, such as the gods and goddesses who intervened in the war and the heroes who fought on both sides, were incorporated into the epic poems to add depth and meaning to the story.\n\nThe historical basis for the Trojan War is still a topic of debate among historians and archaeologists. Some believe that the war may have been based on a real conflict that took place in the Bronze Age, possibly around 1200 BCE, while others argue that the story is entirely mythical.\n\nRegardless of its historical basis, the story of the Trojan War has had a profound impact on Western culture, inspiring countless works of art, literature, and film over the centuries. Its themes of heroism, duty, and the human cost of war continue to resonate with audiences today.",

It was known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and powerful V8 engine.\n\nThe decision to discontinue the Town Car was likely due to a combination of factors, including declining sales, increased competition from other luxury brands, and changing consumer preferences towards more fuel-efficient and smaller vehicles. Lincoln has since focused on other models, such as the MKZ and Continental, which offer a more modern and sporty take on the luxury sedan.\n\nHere is a brief timeline of the Lincoln Town Car:\n\n* 1980: The Lincoln Town Car was introduced as a replacement for the Lincoln Continental Mark V.\n* 1984: The Town Car underwent a major redesign, including a new body style and a more powerful V8 engine.\n* 1990: The Town Car was updated with a new front end and interior features.\n* 1998: The Town Car was again updated with a new exterior and interior design, as well as a new V8 engine.\n* 2003: The Town Car underwent a major redesign, with a new body style and features such as a heated steering wheel and a reverse sensing system.\n* 2010: The Town Car was the last model year for the car, with production ending in September of that year.\n\nOverall, the Lincoln Town Car was a popular and well-regarded luxury sedan that was in production for over three decades. While it is no longer in production, it remains a memorable and iconic vehicle in the history of Lincoln and the automotive industry.",

This represents about 1.4% of the total GDP of the United States.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the GDP of Puerto Rico is roughly the same size as the GDP of Montana or the District of Columbia. However, it's important to note that Puerto Rico has a much larger population than these states or districts, with around 3.2 million people living on the island.\n\nPuerto Rico's economy is driven primarily by manufacturing, tourism, and government spending. The island is home to several major pharmaceutical companies, and the manufacturing sector accounted for about 60% of Puerto Rico's GDP in 2020. Tourism is also an important sector, with over 3 million visitors arriving on the island each year.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Puerto Rico is not a separate nation, its economy is subject to the same challenges and opportunities as any other country. In recent years, the island has faced challenges such as debt and a declining population, but it has also made efforts to diversify its economy and attract new businesses and investment.",
